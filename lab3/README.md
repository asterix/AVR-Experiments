##Scheduling tools

### 1 - Static scheduler

The solutions to part-1 of the assignment are under the folder ```part1```.
The generated schedule table and missed deadlines' analysis is in the files

```Workload 1 - schedule_workload_1.dat```
```Workload 2 - schedule_workload_2.dat```

NOTE: Missed deadlines' analysis is done implicity and efficiently while generating the table hence obviating the need for an extra sub-routine.


### 2 - Time demand analyzer
